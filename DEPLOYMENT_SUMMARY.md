## ✅ Major Fixes & Milestones
1.  **MongoDB Atlas Migration:** Successfully moved from local MongoDB to the cloud. Updated `backend/.env` with the secure connection string.
2.  **Netlify Build Optimization:** 
    *   Corrected build command typo (`frontend` folder prefix).
    *   Set `CI=false` to prevent ESLint warnings from crashing the build.
    *   Added `_redirects` file for React Router support.
3.  **Cross-Platform UI Fixes:**
    *   Refined the **Home Page** stats with premium gradients and icons.
    *   Fixed **Mobile Navbar** to be right-aligned on phones with a compact logo.
4.  **Backend Stability:**
    *   Resolved "Duplicate Schema Index" in `Payment.js`.
    *   Removed deprecated Mongoose options in `server.js`.
    *   Implemented enhanced registration validation (Email + Phone duplicate check).
5.  **Research Hub & Managed Resources:** Built a community sharing platform with Admin/Librarian approval workflow and seeder for 25+ academic resources.
6.  **Identity & Identification:** 
    *   Deployed **Student Digital ID** with dynamic QR Code generation.
    *   Integrated **QR Scanner** for identification and quick book issuing.
7.  **Enhanced Book Entry:** Added **Local Book Cover Upload** (Multer) and made ISBN optional with sparse indexing.
8.  **Verified Payments:** Created a dedicated UI for Admins to verify manual student UPI/Bank payments.

## 🚀 Future Updates (How-To)
To update your website in the future, just use these commands in your terminal:
1. `git add .`
2. `git commit -m "Your update description"`
3. `git push origin main`
*Netlify and Render will handle the rest automatically!*

## 🏗️ Seeding the Database
If you ever clear your database and need the sample books back, run:
`npm run seed --prefix backend`
